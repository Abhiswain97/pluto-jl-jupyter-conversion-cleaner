# pluto-jl-jupyter-conversion-cleaner

This repository contains code to clean the Jupyter notebooks converted from Pluto.jl using: 
[pluto-jl-jupyter-conversion](https://observablehq.com/@olivier_plas/pluto-jl-jupyter-conversion) 

The original conversion from pluto to jupyter using: 
[pluto-jl-jupyter-conversion](https://observablehq.com/@olivier_plas/pluto-jl-jupyter-conversion) makes even the the markdown cells as code cells. 
My intention was to write code using [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) and use [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) to make it into a blog post.
